# Welcome!
Welcome to [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode) and thanks for your interest in contributing. Everything Operation Code does is open source. We've got quite a few repos, and we understand that can be overwhelming, so you can use this list of repos to learn what the main applications are and what languages they use.

## Hacktoberfest
